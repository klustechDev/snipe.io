Snipe.io
<!-- Replace with your actual banner image URL -->
Snipe.io is a sophisticated Ethereum-based sniping bot designed to automatically detect and capitalize on newly created liquidity pairs on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap V2. By leveraging smart contract interactions and real-time event monitoring, Snipe.io ensures that users can efficiently and effectively engage in profitable token swaps as soon as new tokens are listed.

________________________________________
Configuration
Ensure your hardhat.config.js is correctly set up with the appropriate Solidity version and network configurations. Below is an example configuration:
javascript
Copy code
// hardhat.config.js

require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers");
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");

Usage
1. Deploying MockToken
Deploy a mock ERC-20 token to your local Hardhat network. This is essential for testing liquidity addition and bot functionality without interacting with the mainnet.
bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/deployMockToken.js --network localhost
Script Explanation:
•	deployMockToken.js: Deploys a MockToken contract with an initial supply to the deployer's address.
2. Simulating Pair Creation
Simulate the creation of a new liquidity pair involving your MockToken and WETH. This helps in testing the bot's ability to detect new pairs.
bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/simulate_pair_creation.js --network localhost
Script Explanation:
•	simulate_pair_creation.js: Interacts with the Uniswap V2 Factory to create a new pair between MockToken and WETH.
3. Adding Liquidity
Add liquidity to the newly created pair to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity for your bot to perform swaps.
bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/AddLiquidity.js --network localhost
Script Explanation:
•	AddLiquidity.js: Approves the Uniswap V2 Router to spend MockToken and WETH, then adds liquidity to the pair.
4. Running the Bot
Start the sniping bot to listen for new pair creations and execute swaps automatically.
bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/index.js --network localhost
Script Explanation:
•	index.js: The main bot script that listens for PairCreated events and attempts to buy the newly listed tokens upon detection.

Sniping Strategies
1. Real-Time Pair Detection
•	Functionality: The bot continuously monitors the Ethereum blockchain for PairCreated events emitted by the Uniswap V2 Factory. This ensures immediate detection of newly created liquidity pairs.
•	Implementation: Utilizes Ethers.js to connect to the Ethereum network and listen for specific smart contract events.
2. Automated Token Swapping
•	Functionality: Upon detecting a new liquidity pair involving WETH, the bot automatically executes a token swap from WETH to the newly listed token.
•	Implementation: Interacts with the Uniswap V2 Router smart contract to perform swapExactETHForTokens transactions, ensuring swift and efficient trading.
3. Liquidity-Based Profitability Assessment
•	Functionality: Before executing a swap, the bot assesses the liquidity of the new pair by analyzing the WETH reserves. This ensures that trades are only made on pairs with sufficient liquidity, mitigating risks associated with low-liquidity tokens.
•	Implementation: Fetches reserve data from the Uniswap Pair contract and compares it against a predefined liquidity threshold (e.g., ≥500 WETH).
4. Gas Optimization
•	Functionality: The bot dynamically adjusts gas prices based on current network conditions to prioritize its transactions. This increases the likelihood of timely execution, essential for capitalizing on fleeting trading opportunities.
•	Implementation: Fetches current gas prices using Ethers.js provider methods and applies a multiplier (e.g., 1.2x) to set higher gas prices for faster transaction processing.
5. Slippage Control
•	Functionality: To protect against price volatility and ensure favorable trade executions, the bot calculates and sets a minimum acceptable output amount based on a predefined slippage tolerance (e.g., 5%).
•	Implementation: Uses Uniswap's getAmountsOut function to determine expected outputs and adjusts the amountOutMin parameter accordingly in swap transactions.
6. Automated Profit Taking
•	Functionality: After purchasing a new token, the bot continuously monitors its price. Once the token's price increases by a specified profit threshold (e.g., 10%), the bot automatically sells the tokens back to ETH, securing profits.
•	Implementation: Utilizes the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time token and ETH prices. Upon meeting the profit condition, it executes a swapExactTokensForETH transaction to sell the tokens.
7. Secure and Efficient Operations
•	Functionality: Ensures that all operations are conducted securely, with best practices in key management and smart contract interactions.
•	Implementation: Stores sensitive information like private keys in environment variables and interacts with smart contracts using Ethers.js with secure provider configurations.

3. Final Steps to Push Changes to GitHub
Since you've encountered merge conflicts and have now attempted to resolve them, ensure the following steps are completed to successfully push your changes:
1.	Ensure All Conflicts Are Resolved:
o	Open scripts/index.js and confirm that all conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) have been removed and the code reflects the desired final state.
o	Save the file after resolving conflicts.
2.	Stage the Resolved File:
bash
Copy code
git add scripts/index.js
3.	Commit the Merge Resolution: Since you've already run git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in scripts/index.js" and received nothing to commit, working tree clean, it implies that conflicts are resolved and staged.
4.	Pull the Latest Changes with Rebase: To align your local branch with the remote branch without creating a merge commit:
bash
Copy code
git pull --rebase origin main
o	If Conflicts Arise Again:
	Resolve them as previously described.
	Stage the resolved files:
bash
Copy code
git add path/to/conflicted-file.js
	Continue the rebase:
bash
Copy code
git rebase --continue
5.	Push Your Changes: After successfully rebasing and ensuring your local branch is up-to-date:
bash
Copy code
git push origin main
o	If You Still Encounter Errors:
	Force push your changes (use with caution):
bash
Copy code
git push origin main --force
	Warning: Force pushing can overwrite remote history. Ensure this is safe to do in your project context.
6.	Verify on GitHub:
o	Navigate to https://github.com/klustechDev/snipe.io to confirm that your scripts/index.js and README.md have been updated successfully.
