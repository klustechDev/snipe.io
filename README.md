________________________________________
üíª Installation
1.	Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone git@github.com:klustechDev/snipe.io.git
cd snipe.io
2.	Install Backend Dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
3.	Navigate to Frontend Directory and Install Dependencies
bash

________________________________________
‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
1. Setup Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project (~/sniping-bot) and add the following variables:
dotenv
Copy code
# .env

# Ethereum Node RPC URLs
RPC_URL_MAINNET=YOUR_ETHEREUM_MAINNET_RPC_URL
RPC_URL_LOCAL=YOUR_ETHEREUM_LOCAL_RPC_URL

# Uniswap Router and Factory Addresses
ROUTER_ADDRESS=0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D
FACTORY_ADDRESS=0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f

# Base Token Address (e.g., WETH)
BASE_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2

# Mock Token Address (for testing purposes)
MOCK_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x021DBfF4A864Aa25c51F0ad2Cd73266Fde66199d

# Your Wallet's Private Key (KEEP THIS SECURE!)
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY

# Trading Settings
ETH_AMOUNT_TO_SWAP=0.1
SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE=5
GAS_PRICE_MULTIPLIER=1.2
PROFIT_THRESHOLD=5
DEADLINE_BUFFER=60
MINIMUM_LOCKED_ETH=0.05
MAX_GAS_PRICE=200
CHECK_INTERVAL=60
MONITOR_DURATION=300

# Database Settings
DATABASE_PATH=./database/trades.db

# Log Settings
LOG_FILE=./logs/bot.log

# Token Lists (comma-separated addresses)
TOKEN_WHITELIST=0x1234567890abcdef,0xabcdef1234567890
TOKEN_BLACKLIST=0xabcdef1234567890,0x1234567890abcdef
‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure that the .env file is not tracked by Git to prevent exposing sensitive information. The .gitignore is already configured to exclude .env.
2. Secure .env File
If not already done, ensure .env is added to .gitignore:
bash
Copy code
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
3. Verify Addresses and RPC URL
‚Ä¢	RPC_URL_MAINNET: Obtain from providers like Infura, Alchemy, or QuickNode.
‚Ä¢	ROUTER_ADDRESS & FACTORY_ADDRESS: Ensure they match the DEX you're targeting (default is Uniswap V2).
‚Ä¢	BASE_TOKEN_ADDRESS: Typically WETH for ETH-based pools.
‚Ä¢	PRIVATE_KEY: Keep this secure and never expose it publicly.

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
1. Proxy Errors
Issue:
plaintext
Copy code
Proxy error: Could not proxy request /api/logs from localhost:3002 to http://localhost:3001.
See https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_common_system_errors for more information (ECONNREFUSED).
Solution:
‚Ä¢	Ensure Frontend Proxy Configuration Points to Backend Port (3001):
1.	Open frontend/package.json.
2.	Update the proxy field:
json
Copy code
"proxy": "http://localhost:3001",
3.	Restart the frontend server:
bash
Copy code
cd ~/sniping-bot/frontend
npm start
2. Port Conflicts (EADDRINUSE)
Issue:
plaintext
Copy code
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3001
Solution:
‚Ä¢	Identify and Terminate Processes Using Port 3001:
o	For Linux/Mac:
bash
Copy code
lsof -i :3001
kill -9 <PID>
o	For Windows:
bash
Copy code
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
‚Ä¢	Restart Backend Server:
bash
Copy code
cd ~/sniping-bot
npm start
3. Event Listener Errors
Issue:
plaintext
Copy code
Error setting up event listeners: events require a provider or a signer with a provider (operation="once", code=UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION, version=contracts/5.7.0)
Solution:
‚Ä¢	Ensure Proper Contract Initialization:
o	Factory Contract: Should be initialized with a provider.
o	Router Contract: Should be initialized with a wallet (which includes the signer).
‚Ä¢	Sample Initialization:
javascript
Copy code
factoryContract = new ethers.Contract(FACTORY_ADDRESS, factoryABI, provider);
routerContract = new ethers.Contract(ROUTER_ADDRESS, routerABI, wallet);
‚Ä¢	Avoid Re-initializing Contracts Inside Functions: Use globally defined instances.
‚Ä¢	Restart Backend Server After Changes:
bash
Copy code
cd ~/sniping-bot
npm start
4. Wallet Balance Issues
Issue:
plaintext
Copy code
Wallet Balance: 0.0 ETH
Solution:
‚Ä¢	Fund Your Wallet:
o	Transfer ETH to your wallet address: 0x3772316FD86F64C7aa672ef8f2D4a19A7394d53d.
o	Use Etherscan to verify the balance.
